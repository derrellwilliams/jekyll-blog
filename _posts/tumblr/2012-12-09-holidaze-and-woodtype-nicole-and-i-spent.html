copy: holidaze and woodtype
  Nicole and I spent yesterday at my old place of employment, Hemmert Studios, where they graciously let us mess around with some odds and ends of a few incomplete wood type families. We could only find one “Y” from another face, among other issues, as you can see. But that’s kinda what we like about old wood type. It’s always nice to get off the ol’ computer and get ink all over ourselves.
  We also had a pair of 3D glasses, so we were attempting to get three dimensional on one of the prints. Not sure if we succeeded there — when you put on the glasses it’s mostly just blurry.
