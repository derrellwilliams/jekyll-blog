<img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_lw0efw0Kih1qi6gh2o1_r1_1280.jpg"/></br><p>Met up with my friend Yung-Jae today. Haven&#8217;t seen him in&#8230;15 years. Yeah, I am only 24. It&#8217;s been awhile. He took us to a great place for lunch and then we ate at his apartment which had this view of Boston.</p>
