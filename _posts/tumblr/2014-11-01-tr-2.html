copy: Nicole and I were looking for a quick trip outside of the city for some camping and we decided to check out Harriman State Park. We had done some hiking and camping in the area closer to Bear Mountain but never on the Harriman side and it seemed like the main trail there was to the Pinewood Meadow Lake, accessible from the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Reeves+Meadow+Information+Center/@41.173988,-74.168467,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x3bf9f138be8dcf93?sa=X&ei=mjtMVKeTL4HKggTDkYGoCA&ved=0CH8Q_BIwCg&scrollwheel=false">Reeves Meadow</a> parking lot. Finding overnight parking is always stressful this close to NYC, but we spoke to the ranger there and Reeves Meadow was a'okay for overnight parking. What we weren't expecting was the lot to be full. Turns out we weren't the only people to think of this trail for fall day with good weather. We ended up waiting a few minutes and got lucky when a spot opened up. Most of the day hikers were just about leaving around 3pm, when we were just getting started so it didn't turn out to be that crowded. The trailhead, as marked on the map below, is South East of the vistors center, it's the obvious trail with the red blazes.<br><br> The hike to the Lake was probably around 2 miles, no large inclines, pretty chill. The red blazes are very clearly marked so it's pretty hard to get off track. (If you are interested you can download a high-res map of all the trails at Harriman <a href="http://www.myharriman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Master_harriman_map_alltrails.pdf">here.</a>) After hiking up to the Lake on the well-marked trail we started looking around the lake for a good spot to camp, we found a deer trail about a 1/2 mile farther down the trail that we took up to a ridge where we found a few fairly flat lookouts over the lake where we decided to camp. (See map below!) From here we were almost within site of Lake Wanoksink, which also had numerous places to camp out. By no means was this the only place to hangout. <br><br> (Note! Turns out, backcountry camping in the area is frowned upon, so consider yourself warned. If you are hiking and camping without leaving any trace, cleaning up after others along the way, and not bothering anyone, you'll probably be fine :) <br><br> <iframe src="https://mapsengine.google.com/map/u/1/embed?mid=z28a7VabHV-8.kQTw0QLfp7cE" width="100%" height="350"></iframe>
