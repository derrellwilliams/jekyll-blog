title: While working on some material for “The Black Power Mixtape” with Stefania
  (www.stefania.se) I ran across a photo from 1968 of some crazy lettering at a Barber
  shop I recognized, but instead of “Your” it said “Shabazz”. After some intense Sherlock
  work, (ok, maybe it wasn’t that hard) we saw the remains of “Shabazz” below “Your”.
