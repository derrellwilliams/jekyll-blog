copy: Nicole and I arrived in LA and headed straight to Joshua Tree. It had been almost a decade since the last time I had been there and I was pretty excited to hang out in the desert. The drive from LAX is about 3 hours. We also made a quick stop at REI in Rancho Cucamunga to buy a crash pad. We decided that instead of dragging one on the plane and potentially paying half of its cost in luggage fees we would just buy one and then put it on Craigslist at the end of our trip. (Spoiler alert, That plan worked pretty great.)<br><br> We were planning on grabbing a backcountry permit, but after looking over where we wanted to climb, basically everything we wanted to check out was by an official campsite, Hidden Valley Campground. We drove through the park till we got to the Hidden Valley Campground, around 10am. There were still campsites available, but it's a popular place it turns out. We lucked out grabbing the last campground on the north east fork where it felt pretty isolated.
