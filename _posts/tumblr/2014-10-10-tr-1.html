copy: Nicole and I were looking for a quick trip outside of the city for some camping and we decided to check out Harriman State Park. We had done some hiking and camping in the area closer to Bear Mountain but never on the Harriman side and it seemed like the main trail was the Pinewood Meadow Lake, accessible from the Reeves Meadow parking lot. Finding overnight parking is always stressful this close to NYC, but we spoke to the ranger there and it seemed that anything that was an official lot on 7 Lakes Drive was good to go, including Reeves Meadow. What we weren't expecting was the lot to be full! Turns out we weren't the only people to think of this trail for the day. We ended up waiting a few minutes until a spot opened but for the first bit of the trail it was pretty crowded. As the afternoon wore on, and we eventually left the main trail, we didn't see many other hikers.<br><br> After hiking up to the Lake on the well-marked trail we started looking around the lake for a good spot to camp, we found a deer trail about a 1/2 mile on the trail that we took up to a ridge where we found a few fairly flat lookouts over the lake where we decided to camp. From here we were almost within site of Lake Wanoksink, which also had numerous places to camp out. By no means was this the only place to hangout.
